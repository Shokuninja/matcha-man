                        "Lofi beats to relax/study to", or as it's more commonly known, "Lofi Girl", is a popular live stream on YouTube. 
                        It's allowed bibliophiles and romanticizers of academia like myself, to listen to some lofi and feel like they're studying alongside others. 
                        It's a "virtual common room". There has also been an expansion to the "Lofi lore" with the introduction of 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xDzrJKXOOY" target="_blank">Synthwave Boy</a>! The plot thickens with the introduction of a new character!
                        Will Lofi Girl and Synthwave Boy ever find each other? Stay tuned to find out!

                <dt><h3>Forming a healthier relationship with technology</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        In my quest for productivity, one technique I've worked to impliment, is building a more healthy relationship with technology. 
                        The ways in which I've gone about doing that include:
                         <dl>
                            <dt><h4>Turning my phone off at night</h4></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Turning off my phone at night has helped me get to sleep sooner. It's also helped me practice setting healthy boundaries with my phone.
                                    Truthfully, it's something I'd reccomend to anyone. Regardless of whether their phone has been demanding too much of their attention!

                            <dt><h4>Watchlist Management</h4></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Long ago, I decided to delete all the major streaming apps from my phone. (Though Crunchyroll did make frequent appearances) 
                                    Since then, YouTube had become my main time waster. I told myself I was keeping it because it was "educational". And educational it was! 
                                    However, looking through my watch history showed a few too many videos that wouldn't quite educate me in ways that would 
                                    help me personally. So I came up with "<em>Watchlist Management</em>". (Side note, this can be applied to all sorts of streaming. Not 
                                    just YouTube!) With watchlist management, you set your watchlist to sort from oldest to newest. And then when you go on to YouTube 
                                    (or any other streaming service) you watch videos from your watchlist. As apposed to simply clicking on a video reccomended on your home page.
                                    Of course if you're looking for a particular video, then watch that one. But if you're like me and you use YouTube to pass the time, then try 
                                    passing the time by working through that frighteningly long watchlist! And setting it to show the oldest videos first helps you get to stuff 
                                    you've been meaning to get to. And if you come across a video you no longer feel attached to, feel free to let it go!
